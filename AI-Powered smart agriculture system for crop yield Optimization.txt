AI-Powered Smart Agriculture System for Crop Yield Optimization

Introduction:
Smart agriculture integrates Internet of Things (IoT) devices with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance decision-making and optimize crop yields. This system leverages real-time environmental data to improve farming efficiency, reduce waste, and promote sustainability.

IoT Sensors Required:
To collect accurate on-field data, the following sensors will be deployed:
Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures water availability in the soil.
Temperature Sensor: Captures both air and soil temperature.
Light Sensor (Photometer): Monitors sunlight exposure levels.
Humidity Sensor: Tracks the air's moisture content.
pH Sensor: Determines the soil's acidity or alkalinity.
GPS Module: Records location-specific data for spatial mapping.

AI Model for Yield Prediction:
A regression-based machine learning model such as Random Forest Regression or Linear Regression will be used to predict crop yields. The model will be trained on historical data combined with real-time sensor inputs. Key functions include:
Predicting crop yield based on environmental conditions.
Detecting anomalies that may indicate pests or diseases.
Recommending optimal irrigation and fertilization schedules.

Expected Impact:

Increased agricultural productivity through precise, data-driven actions.
Reduction in overuse of water and fertilizers, leading to cost savings.
Early detection of potential threats to crops.
Real-time decision support for farmers via a dashboard or mobile app.

Data Flow Diagram Description:

1. IoT sensors gather data on soil, weather, and plant conditions.
2. A microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino) collects and preprocesses this data.
3. Data is transmitted to a cloud platform or edge computing device.
4. The AI model processes the data to make predictions.
5. Results and recommendations are displayed on a farmer-friendly dashboard or mobile app.
